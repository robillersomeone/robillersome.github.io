                <h3>let's start with a function</h3>
                <p> 
                  the <strong>gamma</strong> function to be exact. 
                  <br> 
                  <br>
                  which looks like this equation.
                </p>
                <!-- paragraph for the equation for the gamma function -->
                <p> &#x393; (n) = (n-1)! </p>
                <p> 
                  that function along with euler's number, fractions, and some exponents make a distribution with a shape and scale. 
                  we call the shape and scale the parameters of the distribution and we call the distribution
                  the <strong>gamma distribution</strong>.

                <p>
                  the gamma distribution is a building block for others - let's take a look at the <strong>exponential distribution</strong>.
                </p>

                brings us back to the first graph.
              </p>
              <p>
                an exponential distribution is a type of gamma distribution 
                where the <span class="mono">shape</span> parameter is set to one.
              </p>
              <p>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <!-- fifth paragraph - exp(1) -->
                <!-- probably gonna go expo(1) because rate/scale issue -->
                <h3>
                  the exponential distribution moves as the <span class="mono">scale</span> changes
                </h3>
                <p> 
                  <!-- add the fact rate is inverse of scale -->
                  however, when we think of the exponential distribution moving we talk about the <span class="mono">rate</span> changing. 
                  <br> 
                  <br>
                  this is because thinking of <span class="mono">rate</span> as the parameter in exponential distributions
                  lets us solve problems.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  the <span class="mono">rate</span> is equal the inverse of the <span class="mono">scale</span> in the gamma distribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  here is an <strong>exponential distribution</strong> with <span class="mono">rate=1</span>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>
                <!-- sixth paragraph - data erlang(2,2) -->
                getting back to gamma
              </h3>
              <p> 
                while the exponential distribution lets us solve some problems, we can solve new ones if we add a bunch of 
                exponential distributions together.
              </p>
              
              <p>this graph is made by <strong>adding</strong> two exponential distributions together, both with <span class="mono">rate=.5</span></p>
              
              <p>
                
                since the <span class="mono">shape</span> of an exponential distribution is always one, 
                the <span class="mono">shape</span> parameter of the gamma distribution 
                that comes from adding exponentials will always be a positive whole number.
                <br>
                <br>
                when that happens we call it an <strong>erlang distribution</strong>, which you can see
                with a <span class="mono">shape=2</span> and  <span class="mono">scale=2</span>
              </p>

              <p> 
                we can make one more distribution by picking certain values for our
                gamma function, the <strong>chi-squared distribution</strong> .
              </p>
              <p>
                this one is seen in stats classes when doing the test for indepedence to see if two or more classes are mutually exclusive, it has one
                parameter, <span class="mono">degrees of freedom</span>. here the

              </p>
              <p>
                to make the chi-squared distribution from the gamma distribution, we set the <span class="mono">scale</span>
                to two and divide the  <span class="mono">shape</span> by two.
                <!-- the <span class="mono">shape/2</span> is equal to <span class="mono">degrees of freedom=6</span> -->

                <strong>exponential</strong> predicts the time until something happens, 
                <strong>erlang</strong> is used to predict how long you'll wait in a queue,

                 the <strong>beta distribtuion</strong> is made of using two independent gamma distributions. 
              </p>
              <p> beta(a, b) = gamma(a, θ) / ( gamma(a,θ) + gamma(b, θ) )</p>
              <p>
                where a and b are the two parameters of the beta distribution called alpha and beta. 
                here we set <span class="mono">alpha=4, beta=6</span>.
              </p>
              <p>
                the beta distribution looks larger on the graph, because it has a different support (x values). 
                it is defined from <span class="mono">[0,1]</span>, while the gamma distribution is defined from
                <span class="mono">[0,∞]</span>, so we zoomed in a little.

              <p> 
                the beta distribution is named because of the <strong>beta function</strong>. the beta function has two parameters
                and can be written in terms of the gamma function. 
              </p>

                in this graph we changed the the parameters of the distribution to <span class="mono">alpha=3, beta=2</span>.

              <p> 
                if we set the two parameters of the beta distribution to  <span class="mono">alpha=1, beta=1</span>
                we get a horizontal line, which is called the <strong>uniform distribution</strong>.
              </p>
              <p> we can interpret a uniform distribution as every outcome being equally likely. 
                because of this, we use the uniform parametrization of the beta distribution 
                as a common starting point or conjugate prior in bayesian statistics.

              <p> 
                the <strong> arcsin distribution</strong> is a common prior distribution in bayesian statistics as well.
                it is just another specific parametrization
                of the beta distribution with <span class="mono">alpha=.5, beta=.5</span>

              <p> 
                the <strong> kumaraswamy distribution</strong> is very similar to the <strong>beta distribution</strong> with two shape parameters,
                but we don't use the beta function to make the probability density function, unlike the beta distribution.
              </p>
              <p>
                also, another way to think about the parameterization of a <strong>uniform distribution</strong> is a as <strong> 
                kumaraswamy distribution</strong> with <span class="mono">alpha=1, beta=1</span>
                , here we set <span class="mono">alpha=5, beta=1</span>

                 if we divide two standard uniform distributions both with parameters <span class="mono">alpha=0, beta=1</span> and then take the log, we get the <strong>laplace distribution</strong>.

              <p> 
                using two laplace distributions, we can build another distribution by dividing them. This makes a common distribution in statistical testing - the <strong>f distribution</strong>.        
              </p>
              <p> 
                the <strong>f distribution</strong> is known as a ratio distribution ~ another common way to make it is by taking the ratio of two <strong>chi-squared distributions</strong> (which are really just gamma distributions). 
                it has two parameters, which are both <span class="mono">degrees of freedom</span>, here both are <span class="mono">degrees of freedom=2</span>

              <p>while the <strong>chi-squared distribution</strong> is used in the test for indepedence, with the <strong>f distribution</strong> 
                we can do analysis of variance (called ANOVA for short) and the f-test for finding the best model in a linear regression.

              <p>
                when looking at wind speed, the magnitude of the speed tends to follow a <strong>rayleigh distribution</strong>, and generally this distribution is helpful when looking for the magnitude of components.

              <p>
                taking the exponential function of the <strong>cauchy distribution</strong> gets us to the last
                distribution we will talk about with a log in the name, the <strong>log-cauchy distribution</strong>.
                like the <strong>cauchy distribution</strong> it has two parameters - <span class="mono">location</span> and <span class="mono">scale</span>.
              </p>
              <p> 
                <strong>log-cauchy distribution</strong> is a heavy tail distribution, mainly cause it is logarithmically decaying.

              </h3>
              <p> 
                 the next three distributions we are going to make by taking the negative log (or natural log) of a distribution we have already seen. if we take the negative log of the  <strong>exponential distribution</strong> with the <span class="mono">rate=1</span> we get the <strong>gumbel distribution</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>gumbel(location, 1) = - log( exponential(1) )</p>
              <p> 
                the <strong>gumbel distribution</strong> has two parameters, the <span class="mono">location</span> and <span class="mono">scale</span>, here the <span class="mono">location=1</span> and <span class="mono">scale=2</span>.

              </h3>
              <p> 
                the <strong>fréchet distribution</strong> is built from taking the negative log of the <strong>uniform distribution</strong> and has three parameters <span class="mono">shape</span>, <span class="mono">scale</span> and <span class="mono">location of minimum</span>.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p> 
                the formula looks more complicated than the gumbel, but we normally set the <span class="mono">scale=1</span> and <span class="mono">location of minimum=0</span>, so the formula ends up being... 
              </p>
              <p>
                fréchet(shape, scale, location) = <var>(- log ( uniform(0,1) ) ) <sup>- (1 / shape)</sup></var>

                or just the negative log of the <strong>uniform distribution</strong> raised to negative inverse of the shape parameter, here <span class="mono">shape=2</span>, <span class="mono">scale=1</span> and <span class="mono">location of minimum=0</span>

              <p> 
                 the last distribution we will build is with the negative natural log and is called the <strong>weibull distribution</strong>. it is very similar to the <strong>fréchet distribution</strong>, but only has two parameters <span class="mono">scale</span> and <span class="mono">shape</span>.
  
              </p>

                here the <span class="mono">scale=1</span> and <span class="mono">shape=1</span>. the <strong>gumbel</strong>, <strong>fréchet</strong>, and <strong>weibull distributions</strong> are all extreme value distributions used in predicting when extreme weather events (like floods) will occur.
